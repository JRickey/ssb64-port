#         SuperSmashBros64           — main executable
#         torch                      — sidecar for first-run extraction
#       Resources/
#         f3d.o2r                    — Fast3D shader archive (ROM-independent)
#         config.yml                 — Torch extraction config
#         yamls/us/*.yml             — Torch extraction recipes
#         gamecontrollerdb.txt       — SDL controller mappings
#
# The bundle is built with NON_PORTABLE=ON so the runtime resolves saves,
# ssb64.cfg.json, and the user's extracted ssb64.o2r out of the OS app-data
# dir (~/Library/Application Support/ssb64/) instead of cwd.
#
# Notes:
# - The .app does NOT include ssb64.o2r — that's ROM-derived and gets
#   extracted on first launch via the ImGui wizard.
# - Code signing / notarization is not handled here; expect Gatekeeper to
#   warn on first launch. A future pass should sign with `codesign --deep`
#   and notarize via `notarytool`.

# Modern Gatekeeper (Sequoia / 15.x+) flags downloaded adhoc-signed
# bundles as "damaged" if the signature isn't deep enough to cover

# individually, but the bundle as a whole isn't sealed — so the .app
# refuses to install / launch from a quarantined DMG.

# every executable and dylib, and writes a bundle-level signature
# referencing all of them. Doesn't need an Apple Developer cert; it's
# enough to satisfy Gatekeeper's structural check on a quarantined
# download. For full "no warnings, no right-click-Open" we'd need a
# real Developer ID Apple Distribution cert + notarization, but that
# costs $99/yr and isn't tractable for an unsigned community port.
